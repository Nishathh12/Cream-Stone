# Cream-Stone
This project is based on asynchronous concept of JavaScript.

In this project, we'll create a simple website that simulates an ice-cream shop using JavaScript's async concepts. The site will feature a button to open or close the shop, and upon opening, it will sequentially display tasks (like ordering, preparation, and serving) using Promises and async/await. Each task will update the user interface to reflect the current step, enhancing user interaction. The project will demonstrate practical application of asynchronous JavaScript in a real-world scenario which will help you to learn JavaScript.
